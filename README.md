# Fetch Data Engineer Take-Home Exercise

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install Docker: Follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Install Docker Compose: Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS. For Linux, follow the instructions on the [Docker Compose installation page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Steps

1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/bandaru5UB/fetch-data-pipeline
   cd fetch-data-pipeline
2. Create docker-compose.yml File: Ensure the docker-compose.yml file is in the root of your project directory.
3. Start Docker Containers

Data Flow

1.Data Ingestion:

Data is ingested into Kafka from a data generator producing messages to the user-login topic.

2.Data Processing:

A Kafka consumer written in Python consumes messages from the user-login topic.
The consumer processes the messages by:
Filtering by device_type (only "android" devices).
Transforming the timestamp from UNIX format to human-readable format.
Aggregating message counts by locale.

3.Data Output:

The processed data is produced to a new Kafka topic named processed-data-topic

Additional Questions

1.How would you deploy this application in production?

Deployment Strategy:

Container Orchestration: Use Kubernetes for deploying, managing, and scaling the Docker containers. Kubernetes provides features like auto-scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities which are essential for a production environment.

Managed Kafka Service: Instead of managing Kafka clusters manually, use a managed Kafka service like Confluent Cloud, AWS MSK, or Azure Event Hubs. These services handle the operational overhead and provide high availability and scalability out of the box.

CI/CD Pipeline: Implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI. This ensures that changes are tested, integrated, and deployed automatically with minimal human intervention.

Monitoring and Logging: Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the application. Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) or a managed logging service to collect and analyze logs.

Secrets Management: Use a secure secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to handle sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, and other configurations.

Security: Implement network security measures like VPC, security groups, and network policies. Use TLS encryption for data in transit and encrypt data at rest. Regularly update and patch dependencies and containers to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

2.What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?

Additional Components:

Load Balancer: Use a load balancer like AWS ELB or NGINX to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your Kafka consumers.

Database: Integrate a database like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery for storing and querying processed data.

Schema Registry: Use Confluent Schema Registry to manage and enforce data schemas for Kafka topics, ensuring data compatibility and consistency.

Message Queue: Implement a message queue like RabbitMQ or AWS SQS for buffering and ensuring reliable message delivery in case of temporary failures or spikes in traffic.

Data Backup: Implement regular backup strategies for critical data, including Kafka topics, databases, and configuration files.

Alerting System: Set up an alerting system using tools like PagerDuty or OpsGenie to notify the DevOps team of any critical issues or downtime.

Service Mesh: Use a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd to manage microservices communication, traffic management, and observability.

3.How can this application scale with a growing dataset?

Scalability Strategy:

Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple instances of Kafka consumers and producers to handle increased data volume. Use Kubernetes for auto-scaling based on resource usage.

Partitioning: Increase the number of partitions in Kafka topics to parallelize data processing and distribute the load across multiple consumer instances.

Data Sharding: Implement data sharding strategies in the database to distribute the data across multiple nodes, improving query performance and storage capacity.

Batch Processing: For large datasets, implement batch processing using tools like Apache Spark or Apache Flink to process and analyze data in chunks.

Data Compaction: Use Kafka log compaction to retain only the latest state of a key, reducing storage requirements and improving performance.

Asynchronous Processing: Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks to avoid blocking the main data pipeline and improve throughput.

Cache: Use caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached to reduce the load on Kafka and databases by caching frequently accessed data.

Cloud Services: Leverage cloud services for storage and compute resources. Use object storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing large volumes of data efficiently.
